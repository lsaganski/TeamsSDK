                    The SDK provides rich voice and video features for the meeting experience with all the UI out of the box. It contains components necessary for meeting joining, audio, video, messaging and sharing features. The framework requires developer just to initialize it and call an API with a meeting URL and everything else is provided by the SDK including Microsoft Teams matching meeting experience. These capabilities require particular storage footprint to include all the UI and runtime optimizations which the Microsoft Teams includes.

						<h2 class="index-title">App Thinning</h2>
						
The SDK framework is not compressed and is for all devices which is supports. Apple uses compressing and optimization process for the app store uploaded applications to thin the app <a href="https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devbbdc5ce4f" target="_blank">What is app thinning? (iOS, tvOS, watchOS) </a>. The user would download only their device specific and required resources.
<br><br>You can generate app size report to know how much would a user download from the app store as described in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/reducing_your_app_s_size#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014195-CH1-MEASURE" target="_blank">Reducing Your App’s Size article</a>.  This will represent the maximum size of the download. The user would download only the architecture which their device requires or files which need updating.

                    Application updates are delivered to the user by downloading files which have actually changed. A resource or binary is not downloaded again if it has not changed.

The Microsoft Teams SDK framework does not contain Bitcode as it does not support it. The SDK is optimized on our side and we are not able to provide Bitcode enabled build.
